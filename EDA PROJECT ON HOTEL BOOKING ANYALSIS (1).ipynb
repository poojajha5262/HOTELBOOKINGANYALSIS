I first decided to take up this project solely due to My mutual interest in Hotel Booking.But when I downloaded the project dataset I was shocked to see so many data in csv file.first thing I had done in this project is that we have make a rough structure that what I need to do in this project and what will be generally the problems and their solution .Then we started working on it . First of all, I Downloaded the \"hotel_bookings.csv\" data file from the almabetter project dashboard to my computer, and then I uplaoded the data from my computer to the Google Drive in order to be able to perform data analysis and get insight from this data by fetching data with importing that data to colab and read it with readcsv. I began by importing all the necessary python packages and libraries. I imported Pandas with the alias pd, imported Numpy with the alias np, and imported matplotlib with the alias plt for the data visualization. I inserted the csv data into Padas dataframe and take some quick insight over the data.\n","This dataset includes information on booking reservasion, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. The database distinguish between the booking information for 2 major hotels types a city hotel and a resort hotel\n","\n","The dataset includes a wide range of booking information with distinguish between city and a resort hotels. Here is a detailed list of the table topics with a short explnation of what each column means and the type of information it is storing:\n","hotel: hotel type(H1 = Resort Hotel or H2 = City Hotel) is_canceled:\n","Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0) lead_time: Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date arrival_date_year:\n","Year of arrival date arrival_date_month: Month of arrival date arrival_date_week_number: Week number of year for arrival date arrival_date_day_of_month: Day of arrival date stays_in_weekend_nights: Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel stays_in_week_nights: Number of week nights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel adults: Number of adults children: Number of children babies: Number of babies country: Country of origin. Categories are represented in the ISO 3155–3:2013 format.\n","\n","After that I find out all null values and all the unexpected values and I replace this null with the other values like setting most repeated values in the place of null values or deleting the some values which doesn't make any sense.\n","\n","Then after preparing all the data I started to used plots to analyze this data in the way for better understanding . First I analyze which types of hotels are there and what are the ratio of it ,and it is observed that there are two types of hotels city hotels and resort hotel. 66% hotels are city hotels and 34% are resort hotels,then I observed between June and the end of August, attendance is at its peak, it is the high season."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our problem statement is that we have to book a hotel/resort so then we need to check which one is best, depends on some of the aspect like what is the seasonality and what are the top performing months?
